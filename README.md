Welcome to My version of TTAPI, Reason it's Java?
I got sick of having to deal with JS Being so lightweight..
So i decided to port it over to Java :)

You will need TTAPI, Which i will link you too at the end of this.
You will also need NodeJS, Which will also be linked.

This is a simple way to do it, At first i made this just to be a bot.

But then i decided to make it an API project since i had nothing else to do.

I will be adding a link to the JS needed to actually run this bot later on.

Thanks for reading this pointless document.
